The SECRET_KEY for the django application is now managed by a Kubernetes Secret.
It is automatically generated when you install the chart.

If you need to manually set the secret, you can create a secret with the name `<release-name>-secret` and the key `SECRET_KEY`.
For example:

kubectl create secret generic <release-name>-secret --from-literal=SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'

You can get the release name by running `helm ls`.
